Morph the porous green pottery sponge into a leather pouch with a dense, moss-like overgrowth — the outer surface appears coarse and fibrous with a loose, netted texture and mottled olive-brown and dark-green tones; scattered across the moss are bright neon-green phosphorescent pinpricks and small glowing clusters that emit a soft, bioluminescent shimmer, giving the pouch a subtly pulsing, otherworldly radiance.

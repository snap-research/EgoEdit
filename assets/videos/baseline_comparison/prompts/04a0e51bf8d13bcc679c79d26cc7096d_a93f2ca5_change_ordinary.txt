Replace the paperback held open in both hands with a magazine with a white, glossy cover featuring a dark rectangular photo panel near the top and a small printed logo/text centered near the bottom; make it spiral-bound along the left edge with a visible coiled spine, the pages slightly curved and smooth, and the cover showing a mild reflective sheen and soft glare over the image area, muting the colors and producing subtle highlights and shadows.

Transform the white-front smartphone with rose-gold case into a handheld calculator with a compact rectangular body and rounded corners, molded in light gray matte plastic with a slightly glossy, dark lcd display window and a small reddish-brown solar strip above it; the keypad features raised round and rectangular buttons in darker gray and black with white numerals and symbols, creating a two-tone contrast; the surface is smooth plastic with mild reflections on the display; there are no special visual effects beyond ambient highlights and soft shadows

Turn the depth map into a video with the following description: the egocentric subject draws on a large white sketchpad resting on a wooden table. I hold a black fineliner pen between my fingers and trace bold outlines, filling paw prints and lettering "DOGS" while sketching dog silhouettes. My left hand, sleeved in green patterned fabric, steadies the paper near a white drawstring and a thin bracelet. Warm overhead light casts soft shadows; head-mounted camera looks down and follows my hand.

Transform the black touchscreen smartphone with keyboard into a passport with a deep burgundy/maroon, leather-like cover that is smooth but slightly textured and shows minor edge wear; place a large gold-foil embossed crest dominating the center, add smaller gold lettering and a biometric chip symbol near the bottom—the foil should be highly reflective and produce bright specular highlights when illuminated, while the cover maintains a subtle matte sheen contrasting the shiny metallic emblem.
